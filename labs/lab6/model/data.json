At the time, the Coca-Cola business in Germany was one of the world’s most successful, second only to the company’s sales in the United States. The modern version of Fanta. The Fanta we know now was born in Naples, Italy, where in 1955 Coca-Cola began using local citrus to formulate the now famous orange flavour. Bright, bubbly and popular, Fanta is the soft drink that intensifies fun. Introduced in 1940, Fanta is the second oldest brand of The Coca-Cola Company."

			"description": "It was 1886, and in New York Harbour, workers were constructing the Statue of Liberty. Eight hundred miles away, another great American symbol was about to be unveiled. Like many people who change history, John Pemberton, an Atlanta pharmacist, was inspired by simple curiosity. One afternoon, he stirred up a fragrant, caramel-coloured liquid and, when it was done, he carried it a few doors down to Jacobs' Pharmacy. Here, the mixture was combined with carbonated water and sampled by customers who all agreed - this new drink was something special. So Jacobs' Pharmacy put it on sale for five cents (about 3p) a glass."
